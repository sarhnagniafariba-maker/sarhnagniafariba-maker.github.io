# Research Interests

As an applied AI researcher with over seven years of experience, my research spans multiple areas at the intersection of **machine learning, deep learning, and biomedical data science**. My work emphasizes both practical applications and the development of explainable, interpretable AI methods that can drive innovation in healthcare and complex systems.

## Core Areas

### 1. Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- Designing and implementing advanced **deep learning models** for structured and unstructured data.
- Applying **language models** and **image analysis** techniques for biomedical and social network applications.
- Developing **robust, generalizable models** for real-world deployment.

### 2. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)
- Creating AI models that are **transparent and interpretable** for clinicians and researchers.
- Using feature attribution, attention mechanisms, and SHAP-driven approaches to **understand model decisions**.
- Bridging the gap between **predictive performance and clinical trust**.

### 3. Network Science & Link Prediction
- Modeling complex networks, including **social networks, bipartite networks, and biological networks**.
- Developing **novel similarity measures** and ensemble methods for **link prediction** and network optimization.
- Exploring network dynamics to **analyze hereditary diseases and information propagation**.

### 4. Optimization & Meta-Heuristic Algorithms
- Solving **routing, scheduling, and resource allocation problems** using meta-heuristic techniques (e.g., Genetic Algorithms, Cuckoo Search).
- Balancing **efficiency, accuracy, and scalability** in large datasets.

### 5. AI Applications in Bioinformatics and Healthcare
- Integrating **multi-omics data** for predictive modeling in precision medicine.
- Using AI to **stratify patients for therapies**, improve diagnostic workflows, and identify molecular biomarkers.
- Collaborating with interdisciplinary teams to **translate AI models into clinical insights**.

## Research Philosophy

I am passionate about **creating AI solutions that are both scientifically rigorous and practically impactful**. I prioritize reproducible research, open collaboration, and models that are interpretable and actionable in real-world biomedical and technological contexts. My work bridges **computational methods, statistical modeling, and domain-specific applications** to solve challenging problems in healthcare, social networks, and optimization.
