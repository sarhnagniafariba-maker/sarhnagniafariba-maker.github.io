# About Me

Hello! I'm **Fariba Sarhangnia**, an Applied AI researcher with over **7 years of experience** in **machine learning**, **deep learning**, **optimisation**, and **biomedical data modelling**. I have a strong passion for leveraging AI to solve complex problems in **healthcare**, **bioinformatics**, and **network analysis**.

## Research Background

- **Explainable AI (XAI):** Developing transparent AI models that provide meaningful insights for clinical and biomedical applications.  
- **Representation Learning & Network Science:** Focusing on link prediction, network analysis, and optimization in large-scale datasets.  
- **Biomedical Data Modelling:** Integrating multi-modal data (genomics, transcriptomics, and clinical data) for predictive and explainable AI solutions.  

I have published **5+ peer-reviewed articles**, with **36+ citations**, and collaborated across multiple disciplines, mentoring students and contributing to reproducible, high-quality research.

## Professional Experience

- **Applied AI Researcher** – Iranian Telecommunication Manufacturing Company (2017–2022)  
  Worked on optimization algorithms, scheduling, routing, and data-driven modelling projects.  

- **Research Collaborator** – University of Applied Science & Technology (UAST), Shiraz (2023–Present)  
  Collaborating on AI and data science projects, feature attribution studies, and cross-dataset generalization.  

## Teaching & Mentorship

- Designed and taught **Machine Learning** and **Computer Vision** courses for 100+ students.  
- Supervised 20+ deep learning capstone projects, with multiple publications resulting from student research.  
- Organized AI bootcamps and workshops, mentoring students and professionals in Python and AI tools.

## Education

- **MSc in Information Technology (Computer Networks)** – Islamic Azad University, Qazvin, Iran (2014–2017)  
  Thesis: Multi-Criteria Clustering in Wireless Sensor Networks for Fire Detection  

- **BSc in Information Technology** – Payam Noor University, Shiraz, Iran (2009–2014)  
  Capstone Project: Infiltration Node Detection in Wireless Sensor Networks Using Hybrid Algorithms  

## Personal Interests

Outside of research, I enjoy **mountaineering**, **travel**, and experiences that enhance leadership, resilience, and cross-cultural adaptability.
